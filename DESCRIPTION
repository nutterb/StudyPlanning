Title: Evaluating Sample Size, Power, and Assumptions in Study Planning
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Benjamin Nutter
Maintainer: Benjamin Nutter <nutterb@ccf.org>
Description: Sample size and power analyses often focus on a fixed set of
    assumptions.  In many cases, these assumptions are based on results of
    other studies that may or may not generalize well to the current
    application.  The validity of these power analyses is dependent on the
    quality of those assumptions.  The StudyPlanning package provides a
    framework to evaluate sample size and power considerations under a varying
    set of conditions.  This allows the user to investigate the impact unmet
    assumptions will have on the power of the statistical tests.
